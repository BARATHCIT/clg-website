               <h2 style="color:yellow;">Shift I are mainly for the underprivileged and backward community and are funded by the government. Till the year 1971 all the students were under the day college stream. Three vice-principals on each for academics, scholarship and administration share the duties of the aided courses. "Earn while you learn" is a scheme through which the underprivileged students are given an opportunity to earn through part-time jobs in the evenings, while they carry on with their studies during the day. The classes begin at 8.15 a.m. and go on till 1.15 p.m.

As we cannot admit more students in the Aided courses, the economically well of students are admitted in the Self-supporting stream of the College. The class timings are from 1.30 to 6.30 p.m.
